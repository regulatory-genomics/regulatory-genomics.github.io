Dr. Juan Zhang completed her doctoral research at the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin and received her PhD from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany. During her postdoctoral fellowship in Prof. Miguel Ramalho-Santos’s laboratory at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto, she investigated the regulatory functions of transposable elements in early human embryonic development. She will continue her work uncovering the genome’s regulatory mechanisms that drive early embryogenesis.

In her spare time, Juan enjoys caring for houseplants, reading, and practicing yoga.
