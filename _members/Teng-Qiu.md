Teng Qiu obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, where he focused on developing highly effective, efficient, and robust clustering methods. As a postdoctoral researcher at BGI Research, he designed innovative computational algorithms for large-scale single-cell and spatial omics data analysis, tackling key challenges including dimensionality reduction, multi-omics integration, automated cell-type annotation, as well as barcode design and error-correction. He will continue to develop innovative computational methods to advance single-cell research.

Beyond his research pursuits, he enjoys hiking and playing badminton.
